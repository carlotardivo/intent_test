# Intent Classification

Intent classification is the automated association of text to a specific purpose or goal. In essence, a classifier analyzes pieces of text and categorizes them into intents such as Purchase, Downgrade, Unsubscribe, and Demo Request. This is useful to understand the intentions behind customer queries, emails, chat conversations, social media comments, and more, to automate processes, and get insights from customer interactions.

For example, identifying purchasing intent is pivotal in transforming sales leads into fully-fledged customers. And the key to it all is timing. Leads move fast, and even more so in the world of online sales where everything seems to happen at lightning speed. It is critical, therefore, for businesses to address and respond to prospects quickly because it increases their chances of closing sales.

The goal of this test is to build a model to classify the scenario and the intent of a user given a question made.
The candidate should submit:

1. an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the dataset
2. a model trained to classify the intent and/or the scenario features
3. the plot of the metrics obtained from the model
4. pack the model as a web service in python
5. create a docker file that run the model and via the api create at the previous point
6. add examples of curls to call the model and get the prediction
